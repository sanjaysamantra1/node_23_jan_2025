Functions
=========
Pre-Defined/inbuilt : Function Logic is already written, we have to use it
    console : log() ,error(),warn(), table(), trace() , dir(), time(), timeEnd()
    Math : max() , min(), sqrt()
User Defined : We have to write the function & use that
    1. Function Declaration / Named Function
    2. Function Expression
    3. Self Invoked
    4. arrow function

Function Declaration vs Function Expression
===========================================
1. Function Declarations are Named ,  Function Expressions are anonymous
2. Function Declarations are hoisted ,  Function Expressions are not hoisted

Arrow Function
--------------
-'this' value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the context in which it is called.
-'this' inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to 'this' where the function is declared.
-lexical context means that arrow function uses 'this' from the code that contains the arrow function.
-Regular function ( this = how the function is invoked/who invoked )
-Arrow function( this = where the function is declared )


Arrow Function Limitations
--------------------------
-arrow functions shouldn't be used as object methods
