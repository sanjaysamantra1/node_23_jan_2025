Debug NodeJs Code
=================	
1. Debugging natively
  a. node inspect script.js  (type next, help)
     node inspect --port=5000 app.js
     go to browser --> chrome://inspect   OR  about:inspect
  b. use debugger;  in a code line you want
  
cont, c               Resume execution
next, n               Continue to next line in current file
step, s               Step into, potentially entering a function
out, o                Step out, leaving the current function
backtrace, bt         Print the current backtrace
  
  
2. visual Studio Code
   a. In the Debug panel, click the settings icon to open .vscode/launch.json.
   Select "Node.js" for initial setup.
   b. go to the JS file add debug points
   c. go to Debug Panel, click 'Run' button


NPM (Node Package Manager)
==========================
-npm is the standard package manager for NodeJS Applications.
-Node Package Manager (NPM) provides two main functionalities:
	1.Online repositories for node.js packages
	which are searchable on https://www.npmjs.com/
	2.Command line utility to install Node.js packages, do version management and dependency management of Node.js packages.
	
-NPM comes bundled with Node.js installables.
-To verify npm version, Run the below command  
 npm --version/-v
 
-initialize an NPM  project
 npm init
 npm init -y (everything default)


-Install a Module using npm
 npm install <Module Name>

-npm install 
 install all the modules as specified in package.json
 
-Install the package globally
 npm install <package_name> -g
 
-Save the package as dependency
 npm install <package_name> --save
 
-Save the package as dev-dependency
 npm install <package_name> --save-dev 
 
-Install the latest version of a package
 npm install <package_name>@latest
 
-Install any particluar version of a package
 npm install <package_name>@<version_number>
 npm install bootstrap@4.0.1
 
-Uninstalling Packages/Modules via NPM
 npm uninstall <package_name>
 
-Update Packages/Modules via NPM
 npm update <package_name>
 
-Searching a particular package
 npm search <package_name>
 
-List all Installed Packages Locally
 npm list/ls

-List all Installed Packages Globally
 npm ls -g
 
-Run a Script
 npm run <script-name>


npm i nodemon 			 	--> helps during development and production dependencies
npm i nodemon --save  		--> helps during development and production dependencies
npm i nodemon --save-dev  	--> helps during development not in production(-D)
npm i nodemon --no-save 	--> installs but does not add the entry to the package.json file dependencies
npm i nodemon --save-optional --> installs and adds the entry to the package.json file optionalDependencies
npm i --no-optional  --> will prevent optional dependencies from being installed





NPM Global vs Local Installation
================================
-By default, NPM installs any dependency in the local mode. 
-Local mode refers to the package installation in node_modules directory of our project.
-Locally installed packages are accessible via require() method. 
 ex: npm i minimist
    const minimist = require('minimist');
-Run the below command command to list down all the locally installed modules. 
 npm ls
-few packages that should be locally installed:
 1.minimist  2.express  3.lodash  4.bootstrap  5.axios  6.rxjs
-If a module needs to be used inside our code using require(), then install that module locally.
 
 
-Globally installed packages/dependencies are stored in system directory. 
-Such dependencies can be used in CLI (Command Line Interface), they are not meant to be imported using require() in Node application directly. 
 ex:- npm i nodemon -g
      const nodemon = require('nodemon'); //No
-Few packages that should be globally installed: 
 1.npm   2.nodemon  3.typescript  4.create-react-app  5.angular-cli  6.json-server
-Run the below command command to list down all the globally installed modules. 
 npm ls -g
-If we want to use a module in shell/command-prompt not using require(), install that globally.
