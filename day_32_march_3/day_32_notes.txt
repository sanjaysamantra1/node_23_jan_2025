CORS(Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing)
====
-Manages how our server will respond to requests from different origins.
-Controls which domains can access our API or web application by setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin and other headers.

Key Features:
-Prevents unauthorized cross-origin requests: 
	By default, browsers block requests made from one domain to another (a different origin). The cors middleware enables specific domains or all domains to access your resources.
-Customizable origin policies: 
	We can whitelist specific origins, methods, and headers that are allowed to interact with your server.


-CORS is a npm package.
-How to Install
 npm install cors
 
 
How to use cors
===============
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();
app.use(cors());

const corsOptions = {
  origin: 'http://example.com'
}
app.use(cors(corsOptions));


Default Configuration 
corsOptions = {
  "origin": "*",
  "methods": "GET,HEAD,PUT,PATCH,POST,DELETE",
  "preflightContinue": false,
  "optionsSuccessStatus": 204
}

const whitelist = ['http://example1.com', 'http://example2.com']
const corsOptions = {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    if (whitelist.includes(origin)) {
      callback(null, true)
    } else {
      callback(new Error('Not allowed by CORS'))
    }
  }
}

Helmet
======
-It Helps to secure Node.js application by setting several HTTP headers.
-automatically adds or removes HTTP headers to comply with web security standards.
-protect Node.js Express apps from common security threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and click-jacking attacks.
-Express applications do not come with security HTTP headers out of the box.
-Without Helmet, default headers returned by Express expose sensitive information and make your Node.js app vulnerable to malicious actors


curl http://localhost:3000/
curl http://localhost:3000/ --include
Or
use an HTTP client such as Postman to inspect the HTTP headers of the response

without Helmet
==============
-response header should have X-Powered-By header. As with all headers that begin with X-, it is a non-standard header. X-Powered-By indicates the name and version number of the framework or library used by the server to generate the HTTP response.
-we should never give attackers details about our tech stack.
