    find(func) – filter element through the function, return first value that make it return true.
	findLast(func) – filter element through the function, return last value that make it return true.
	filter(func) – filter elements through the function, return all values that make it return true.
	findIndex(func)  - it is like find(), but returns the index instead of a value.
	
To transform the array:
	map(func) – creates a new array from original array by calling func for every element.
	sort(func) – sorts the array in-place, then returns it.
	toSorted() - creates a new array and sorts
	reverse	() – reverses the array in-place, then returns it.
	toReversed() - creates a new array and reverses
	split/join – convert a string to array and back.
	reduce(func, initial) – calculate a single value over the array by calling func for 	each element and passing an intermediate result between the calls.
	flat()   - creates a new array with the elements of the subarrays concatenated into it.flat(Infinity) , flat() also removes holes in array
	flatMap() - maps each element in an array using a mapping function and then flattens the results into a new array
	
To iterate over elements:
	forEach()	– calls func for every element, does not return anything.
